Web map designed as a proposal for efficient asset management of piped water supply systems for Umbrellas of Water and Sanitation.

## Why it is needed?
Many piped water supply systems in rural Uganda are handed over without a structured digital asset record of the as-built infrastructure. As a result, subsequent network modifications, repairs, and extensions are often undocumented. Over the lifespan of the project, this lack of systematic documentation creates significant challenges in asset management, system optimization, and informed decision-making.

Without a reliable digital representation of the infrastructure backbone including pipeline alignments, valves, storage facilities, connections, and service coverage, operators struggle to effectively monitor performance, plan maintenance, or implement targeted expansions. The absence of spatially referenced asset data limits the utility’s ability to detect inefficiencies, manage non-revenue water, and prioritize investments.

Additionally, institutional knowledge is frequently lost due to staff transfers or turnover. Personnel involved during commissioning may relocate or leave their positions, leaving new staff without a clear understanding of system layout and network extent. This knowledge gap increases operational risk, delays response to faults, and reduces overall system resilience.

A digitized, GIS-based asset management framework provides continuity in system management by preserving institutional memory in a structured, accessible format. It enables proper documentation of infrastructure assets, supports consumer data management, improves maintenance planning, and facilitates evidence-based expansion planning. Ultimately, this strengthens operational efficiency, enhances service delivery, and contributes to improved financial sustainability of rural piped water systems.
